**Severity**: Runestaff Syntax Error

## Description

An unterminated string literal occurs when a string is opened with a quotation mark (`"`) but is not properly closed with a matching quotation mark. This results in the assembler being unable to determine where the string ends, leading to a syntax error.

## Example

```rns
; Error: Unterminated string literal
ldc "This string is not closed
```

See the <a href="/syntax/rns-types/#strings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Runestaff Types</a> page for more information on string literal syntax and proper usage.
